              Pebojot noted that he had an interest in learning more about computer programming by the time he started
              classes at AMA Computer University. He studied Computer engineering and Information Technology. Throughout
              his freshman year, he developed a software called Braindotnet, which enabled users to read a topic, take
              quizzes, and monitor progress. A short time later, he revamped the software to encourage students to
              report their results via Really Simple Syndication. <sup><a
