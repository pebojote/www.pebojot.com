<p>
    The role of the developer in software requirement gathering will vary with each team. Large teams put someone in charge of it. This is the business analyst, the product owner, or the project manager. It is very important that you put it on. But it is also important that you work with them so that you understand what they are really doing. If you understand what they’re doing, and what your whole team is doing, it’s just very easy to work with, and it will speed things up.
</p>
<p>
    This is very important especially to senior developers. Many expect that senior developers should attend meetings with stakeholders to determine what stakeholders need, and to determine what product is needed to meet this need. Back then, there was a whiteboard on which stakeholder needs were posted, they were like sticky notes and there were tasks set up for a developer to do, done by just one person. But in the 21st Century, it is no longer done by just one person.
</p>
<p>
  This is why there are workshops that teams in software industry. In the workshop, there are trainings, and prototypes that are shown to the stakeholders. The stakeholders, these are the people who may be interested in your product. If your prototype is about an XBOX gaming software, your stakeholder may be XBOX gamers, your stakeholder may also be a business team if the prototype is related to business management. Your supplier, and most importantly, your end-user, can too. This is done so that the team can get valuable information from stakeholders.
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  The order of your workshops depends on who your stakeholders are. Typically here is how you look at your problem, and how you can solve it instead of doing that solution and making a prototype right away. You might say it’s anti-agile, but you know you need to first see the problem and understand it thoroughly so you can avoid making a wrong solution. In workshops, your stakeholder can tell you a problem which will allow you to figure out what your challenges are, and determine what steps you and your team will take. This step is a process, in software development, it is called the design process. But here in this article, we will use a double diamond model.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  In the double diamond model, you will find a lot of problems, and you will find the most necessary problems. Then, you will find so many solutions, and you will find the most necessary solution. The stakeholder may understand what their problem is, but not the technology, which will help them for it to be fixed. Here the workshops using the double diamond model help because not only do we get the problem and solution from them, but they also know, and we, what technology should be used.

<p>
  The other is the User Experience. The User Experience team puts users through a requirement gathering process. A laboratory -like place where User Experience researchers gather information on the subject. The User Experience practitioner is your best ally in the requirement gather process. Many successful companies have a User Experience team. What these successful companies do is, they combine the Development and User Experience teams into a single process so they work side by side to get user information. The UX team helps the development team, or the development team helps the UX team, this happens to remove the communication barrier that was common in the early days of software development.
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  This type of requirement gathering is qualitative research, that is, they take abstract information, usually in these abstract information are user emotions. But apart from qualitative research, there is also what is called quantitative research. Quantitative research is only effective if the user is already using your product, and this effectiveness will help the stakeholder clearly understand the effectiveness of your product.
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  If you have a real user on your product, it is very easy to get quantitative data using the analytics systems you have. And with this qualitative data, you can use continuous delivery so you can release a new feature early.
</p>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  Many people expect senior developers to attend meetings with stakeholders to figure out what they want. The stakeholder needs were written on a whiteboard at the time. However, in the twenty-first century, it is no longer achieved by a single person. Your stakeholder will tell you an issue in a workshop, which can help you find out what your problems are. This is achieved in order for the team to obtain useful input from stakeholders. The double diamond model will be included in this article.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of getting the approach and creating a prototype straight now, this is usually how you look at the dilemma and how you can solve it. It's anti-agile, but you know you have to see the situation and grasp it fully before coming up with a solution. You will find a lot of problems in the double diamonds model, and you will find the most important problems. Then you'll discover a plethora of options, including the most pressing one. The order in which your workshops are held is determined by the stakeholders involved. The challenge is the issue, not the technologies that will assist them in addressing it.
</p>
<p>
  The Customer Experience team conducts a criteria collection process for customers. Many successful firms merge their production and customer interface teams into one operation. Quantitative research is only effective if the user is already using your product. If you have a real user on your product, it is very easy to get quantitative data using the analytics systems you have. And with this quantitative data, you can use continuous delivery so you can release a new feature early. The User Experience practitioner is your best ally in the requirement gather process.
