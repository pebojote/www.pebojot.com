<p>
  Each team's developer's role in gathering software requirements will be different. Someone is in charge of it in large groups. The <i>business analyst</i>, <i>product owner</i>, or <i>project manager</i> is this person. It is essential that you put it on. However, you must collaborate with them in order to fully comprehend what they are doing. It's just a lot easier to work with if you understand what they're doing, as well as what your entire team is doing.
</p>
<p>
  This is critical, particularly for senior developers. Many people expect senior developers to attend meetings with stakeholders to figure out what they need and what product they need to meet that need. Stakeholder needs were posted on a whiteboard, like sticky notes, and tasks were set up for a developer to complete, which was done by just one person. However, in the twenty-first century, it is no longer done by a single person.
</p>
<p>
  This is why teams in the software industry hold workshops. Trainings and prototypes are displayed to the stakeholders in the workshop. These are the people who might be interested in your product, or stakeholders. If your prototype is about XBOX gaming software, your stakeholders may be XBOX gamers; if the prototype is about business management, your stakeholders may be a business team. Your supplier, and, more importantly, your end-user, can do it as well. This is done in order for the team to obtain useful information from stakeholders.
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  The order of your workshops depends on who your stakeholders are. Typically here is how you look at your problem, and how you can solve it instead of doing that solution and making a prototype right away. You might say itâ€™s anti-agile, but you know you need to first see the problem and understand it thoroughly so you can avoid making a wrong solution. In workshops, your stakeholder can tell you a problem which will allow you to figure out what your challenges are, and determine what steps you and your team will take. This step is a process, in software development, it is called the design process. But here in this article, we will use a double diamond model.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
  In the double diamond model, you will find a lot of problems, and you will find the most necessary problems. Then, you will find so many solutions, and you will find the most necessary solution. The stakeholder may understand what their problem is, but not the technology, which will help them for it to be fixed. Here the workshops using the double diamond model help because not only do we get the problem and solution from them, but they also know, and we, what technology should be used.

  The other is the User Experience. The User Experience team puts users through a requirement gathering process. A laboratory -like place where User Experience researchers gather information on the subject. The User Experience practitioner is your best ally in the requirement gather process. Many successful companies have a User Experience team. What these successful companies do is, they combine the Development and User Experience teams into a single process so they work side by side to get user information. The UX team helps the development team, or the development team helps the UX team, this happens to remove the communication barrier that was common in the early days of software development.
</p>

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  This type of requirement gathering is qualitative research, that is, they take abstract information, usually in these abstract information are user emotions. But apart from qualitative research, there is also what is called quantitative research. Quantitative research is only effective if the user is already using your product, and this effectiveness will help the stakeholder clearly understand the effectiveness of your product.
</p>
</div>

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  If you have a real user on your product, it is very easy to get quantitative data using the analytics systems you have. And with this qualitative data, you can use continuous delivery so you can release a new feature early.
</p>

<p>
  Many people expect senior developers to attend meetings with stakeholders to figure out what they want. However, in the twenty-first century, it is no longer achieved by a single person. Your stakeholder will tell you an issue in a workshop, which can help you find out what your challenges are. The stakeholder needs were written on a whiteboard at the time to obtain useful input from stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
  Rather than grasping the concept and developing a prototype initially, you have to see the situation and grasp it fully before coming up with a solution. You will find a lot of problems in the double diamonds model, and you will find the most important problems. Then you'll discover a plethora of options, including the most pressing one. The order in which your workshops are held is determined by the stakeholders involved. The challenge is the issue, not the technologies that will assist them in addressing it.
</p>
<p>
  The User Experience team conducts a requirement gathering process for customers. Many successful firms merge their Development and User Experience teams into one operation. Quantitative research is only effective if the user is already using your product. If you have a real user on your product, it is very easy to get quantitative data using the analytics systems. And with this quantitative data, you can use Continuous Delivery so you can release a new feature early. The User Experience practitioner is your best ally in the requirement gather process.
