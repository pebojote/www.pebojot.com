    <p>
        You'll need to decide what you're going to make once you've decided what product you need to make. What exactly is it? You must decide what you will do because this will serve as a means of communication with your team, allowing you to fully comprehend the problem and write a solution in the code. User stories have become almost synonymous with agile in many teams, though non-agile user stories also exist. From the perspective of your users, user stories represent what will be a new feature of a system. This is how you usually write them:
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b>As <i>someone</i>, I'd like <i>to do something</i>. In order for me to <i>achieve something</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hypothesis-driven development, or an ad-hoc approach like writing on the back of an index card, is another option. Consider the following scenario:
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b><i>As a user, I'd like to create an account. In order for me to be able to check out faster the next time.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Now comes the big question: is it really necessary for the user to check more quickly? Irrational user stories should be avoided. You might even lose interest in your effort now that they don't need to check it right away. If they do this, the user story above might make sense:
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b><i>[1] As a business, [2] I'd like to create an account. [3] In order for me to learn more about my customers, and because customers with accounts are more likely to return to the app, according to research.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        Unreasonable user stories often occur in number 3. This line is difficult to write because the content still needs quite a bit of explanation. Number 2 depends on your team's discussion. The phraseÂ As a userÂ is one of the indicators of irrational user stories. The first line above can not be applied to another user because users's needs are different. It's critical to know the difference between them when designing a user-friendly product. It's also a good idea to create a persona for them so that you can give them a sense of identity. It can be difficult to write a user story because it covers such a broad range of technology.
    </p>
    <p>
       However, you can turn these user stories into epics, which are similar to user stories but are broken up into smaller chunks. Epics might look something like this if you're making a personal management app: 
    </p>
    <p style="background-color: #D9D9D6;" class="p-1">
        <b><i>As a customer, I'd like to manage my activity. In order for me to be fully productive.</i></b>
    </p>
    <p>
        It can be broken down into small user stories based on various customer activities. Prioritizing these individual user stories is simple. Prioritizing large user stories will be difficult and will cause problems for your team. Because there are unnecessary tasks that arise as a result of a system's unnecessary features.   
    </p>
    <p>
        Bill Wake suggests a mnemonic to help you remember the key elements of a user story. This is referred to as INVEST:
    </p>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>I</b>ndependent</li>
            <li><b>N</b>egotiable</li>
            <li><b>V</b>aluable</li>
            <li><b>E</b>stimatable</li>
            <li><b>S</b>mall</li>
            <li><b>T</b>estable</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>      
      The user story must be independent and not reliant on other user stories ThisÂ meansÂ youÂ canÂ moveÂ itÂ upÂ orÂ downÂ inÂ yourÂ backlogÂ atÂ anyÂ time.Â TheÂ userÂ mustÂ beÂ negotiable. ThisÂ meansÂ thatÂ theÂ user'sÂ storyÂ canÂ beÂ changedÂ orÂ abandonedÂ atÂ anyÂ time.Â IfÂ yourÂ userÂ storyÂ hasÂ aÂ technicalÂ issue yourÂ teamÂ canÂ eitherÂ findÂ anotherÂ userÂ storyÂ orÂ discardÂ itÂ entirely.Â ToÂ makeÂ sense,Â yourÂ userÂ storyÂ mustÂ alsoÂ beÂ valuable AÂ userÂ storyÂ thatÂ keepsÂ youÂ busyÂ butÂ addsÂ littleÂ valueÂ toÂ yourÂ teamÂ shouldÂ beÂ removed.
    </p>
    <p>
    Â SomeÂ teamsÂ assignÂ aÂ pointÂ valueÂ toÂ anÂ item,Â whichÂ aidsÂ usÂ inÂ prioritizingÂ thoseÂ items.Â TheÂ low-costÂ itemÂ hasÂ aÂ highÂ priority,Â whileÂ theÂ high-costÂ itemÂ hasÂ aÂ lowÂ priority.Â ThisÂ meansÂ thatÂ theÂ userÂ storyÂ isÂ alsoÂ estimatableÂ forÂ thisÂ reason.Â It'sÂ difficultÂ toÂ prioritizeÂ aÂ userÂ storyÂ ifÂ youÂ don'tÂ estimateÂ it.Â IfÂ thisÂ isn'tÂ accuratelyÂ estimated,Â there'sÂ aÂ problemÂ withÂ theÂ meaningÂ ofÂ aÂ userÂ story.Â ThisÂ meansÂ thatÂ ifÂ aÂ userÂ story'sÂ meaning isÂ incorrect,Â itÂ canÂ notÂ beÂ implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Small is another feature of a good user story. However, it is contingent on your team's rules. Other teams are competing in a sprint, so the user story must be small for them to move easily. There are other teams that run in the same sprint as well, and it's fine with them if the user story is large as long as they're comfortable with it. The big user story is easy to overlook, resulting in wasted time and effort. The user story is also testable, and that is the final INVEST requirement. There is no other way for the team to know if the user story is properly placed in the backlog if it is not testable. When a requirement is not testable, it may lack meaning, and this lack of meaning leads to a user story that can not be assigned value points.
    </p>
    <p>
      TheseÂ INVESTÂ requirementsÂ alsoÂ contradictÂ oneÂ another.Â IfÂ youÂ wantÂ aÂ userÂ storyÂ toÂ beÂ independent,Â forÂ example,Â youÂ canÂ enlargeÂ it,Â orÂ makeÂ itÂ smaller.Â However,Â accordingÂ toÂ INVEST,Â theÂ userÂ storyÂ shouldÂ beÂ small Â WhenÂ you'reÂ layingÂ theÂ groundworkÂ forÂ aÂ system,Â it'sÂ hugeÂ atÂ first.Â WhenÂ aÂ userÂ storyÂ isÂ large Â theÂ technicalÂ tasksÂ areÂ usuallyÂ largeÂ asÂ wellÂ YouÂ canÂ alsoÂ checkÂ theÂ costÂ estimateÂ toÂ seeÂ ifÂ theÂ bigÂ userÂ storyÂ isÂ affordable.Â YouÂ canÂ makeÂ aÂ MinimumÂ ViableÂ ProductÂ ifÂ theÂ costÂ isÂ low,Â butÂ MVPÂ hasÂ lowÂ value.Â However Â theÂ MVPÂ mayÂ beÂ requiredÂ toÂ becomeÂ BusinessÂ AsÂ UsuaÂ orÂ BAUÂ onÂ occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When a user story is brand new, it frequently fails to meet INVEST's requirements. As a result, the new user story can be added to the planning process's idea section. Before adding a new user story to the backlog, the team checks to see if it has value or is estimatable. And when a new user story has already fulfilled the INVEST requirement. You must decide what steps you will take. Each team has its own way of defining a user story. Another group requires a lengthy definition of a user story. Others, on the other hand, simply want to be brief. It's difficult to find the right determinant level. When you have too much, your efforts may be wasted, and when you don't have enough, you may make mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      AsÂ theÂ projectÂ movesÂ fromÂ theÂ conceptÂ stageÂ toÂ theÂ productionÂ stage,Â you'llÂ needÂ aÂ higherÂ levelÂ ofÂ detail.Â ThisÂ meansÂ thatÂ thereÂ areÂ otherÂ stagesÂ beforeÂ theÂ developmentÂ stage,Â suchÂ as the informationÂ architectureÂ stage.Â AtÂ eachÂ stage,Â youÂ mustÂ haveÂ goodÂ communicationÂ skills.Â IfÂ thereÂ isÂ aÂ technicalÂ issue,Â aÂ seniorÂ developerÂ mayÂ beÂ ableÂ toÂ assist.
    </p>

      The acceptance criteria are the most common level of determination you'll need as a developer. Behavior-driven development is one method that works well in this situation. Where you'll talk about establishing acceptance criteria. Written communication is less effective than verbal communication. It's crucial to ask and answer questions about your team if you want to make a good decision. Verbal communication is used by some teams rather than written communication. "People over process," says the agile manifesto.

  Many people expect senior developers to attend meetings with stakeholders to figure out what they require. The stakeholder needs were written on a whiteboard at the time. However, in the twenty-first century, it is no longer done by a single person. Your stakeholder can tell you a problem in a workshop, which will help you figure out what your challenges are. This is done in order for the team to obtain useful information from stakeholders.
</p>
<p>
  Instead of doing that solution and making a prototype right away, you have to see the problem and understand it completely before coming up with a solution. You will find a lot of problems in the double diamonds model, and you will find the most important problems. Then you'll discover a plethora of options, including the most pressing one. The order in which your workshops are held is determined by the stakeholders involved.
</p>
<p>
  The User Experience team conducts a requirement gathering process with users. Many successful businesses combine their development and user experience teams into one process. Quantitative research is only useful if your product is already in use by the user. It's very easy to get quantitative data using your analytics systems if you have a real user on your product. You can also use continuous delivery with this quantitative data to release a new feature early. In the requirement gathering process, the User Experience practitioner is your best ally.
