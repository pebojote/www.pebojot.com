    The role of the developer in software requirement gathering will vary with each team. Large teams put someone in charge of it. This is the business analyst, the product owner, or the project manager. It is very important that you put it on. But it is also important that you work with them so that you understand what they are really doing. If you understand what they’re doing, and what your whole team is doing, it’s just very easy to work with, and it will speed things up.
</p>
<p>
    This is very important especially to senior developers. Many expect that senior developers should attend meetings with stakeholders to determine what stakeholders need, and to determine what product is needed to meet this need. Back then, there was a whiteboard on which stakeholder needs were posted, they were like sticky notes and there were tasks set up for a developer to do, done by just one person. But in the 21st Century, it is no longer done by just one person.
</p>
<p>
  This is why there are workshops that teams do in the world of software industry. In the workshop, there are trainings, and prototypes that are shown to the stakeholders, the stakeholders, these are the people who may be interested in your product. If your prototype is about an XBOX gaming software, your stakeholder may be XBOX gamers, your stakeholder may also be a business team if the prototype is related to business management. Your supplier, and most importantly, your end-user, can too. This is done so that the team can get valuable information from stakeholders.

<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
  The order of your workshops depends on who your stakeholders are. Typically here is how you look at your problem, and how you can solve it instead of doing that solution and making a prototype right away. You might say it’s anti-agile, but you know you need to first see the problem and understand it thoroughly so you can avoid making a wrong solution. In workshops, your stakeholder can tell you a problem which will allow you to figure out what your challenges are, and determine what steps you and your team will take. This step is a process, in software development, it is called the design process. But here in this article, we will use a double-diamond model.

You must also think like an attacker while collecting data. Giving users a random ID that isn't related to their real identification is one way to anonymize information. With enough data points, it might be possible too to connect this to a real user. In 2006, AOL made available the search logs of their search engine customers, who were connected to anonymous IDs. Journalists were able to positively identify the real users using data points. True anonymity would suggest that there are no data points in the system. For others, privacy is expected, while for others, it is appropriate. One example is the relationship between the state and its people. The NHS expected that care.data program would not only strengthen individual treatment, but also allow researchers to track national health patterns and potentially find new connections between various health conditions. But to the people, the privacy is appropriate. But, it was also impossible to render a cost-benefit comparison in this situation.

Developers must avoid functionality that have detrimental implications for the people who use the softwares we make because it may increase their cognitive workload. There are some categories of softwares on which developers may make an ethical decision. A facial recognition software, for example, may assist a social media user in <i>easily</i> marking images, but if used by a totalitarian regime, it may be used to persecute people. There is no correct answer.

Energy usage is a visible effect IT has on the environment, but it sounds abstract from a developer's viewpoint, particularly as the world transitions to the cloud. When businesses run their own data centres, they could see how much electricity they were consuming. This influence is impossible to see in the cloud.

Via open source, tech developers have a distinct way of communicating. Open source work is performed on a voluntary basis and is subject to licensing. Playing politics or intimidation are also unethical in any occupation, but they are far too prevalent. It is appropriate to use an open source feature as a library within a commercial product, but all improvements made to the library must be restored to the original project so that everyone will benefit.

<h3>Summary</h3>

<hr />
<div style="text-align: justify;font-family:sans-serif;word-spacing: 0px;">
<p>
Ethics is a vital feature in most technical fields, but it is seldom addressed in software development. The following are four ethical issues that you may encounter: Privacy, which is being legislated as a consequence of the profession's ethical failings; cognitive workload, where we can add harmful side effects on our userbase as we rely exclusively on other goals; energy conservation, which can seem hypothetical but has a clear real-world effect; and confidence, both within our profession and for those with whom we operate.
</p>
<p>
There is no one-size-fits-all solution to ethics; rather, it may be arbitrary. Nonetheless, that is something we can take into consideration when developing structures in order to create a sustainable environment for everyone.
