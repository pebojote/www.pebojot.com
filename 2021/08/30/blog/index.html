        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.
    </p>

This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.

        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.

        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.
    </p>

        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.

        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.
    </p>

        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.
    </p>

As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.

        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.

        We all know that design is a specification for the creation of objects. And that it is the designer who creates the specifications. There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.
    </p>

There are landscape designers, industrial designers, furniture designers, and other types of designers. However, I'd like to discuss interaction designers. Interaction design (or IxD) is a technique used by an interaction designer. IxD is a technique for creating interactive objects. It could be a physical object like a hammer or a digital object like a computer.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'd like to concentrate on computers. When we talk about interactive design on computers, we're really talking about how humans (users) interact with computers. Because the computer is an interactive object, it is a human who interacts with it. The human is the one who gives the computer instructions (instruction environment), and the computer is the one who gives the user the result of the instruction (machine environment). It is based on Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) research (or HCI).
    </p>
    <p>
        Human-computer interaction (HCI) is the study of how people interact with computers. However, we will not discuss everything in HCI because this blog is not the appropriate place to learn everything in HCI, but if you are interested, you can conduct a literature review and publish some research papers by going to a school library or Google Scholar. However, rather than publishing a research paper, we will concentrate on software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        I can only give you a few aspects of HCI that you should be familiar with and will use frequently in software development. So, in HCI, there's a method called User-Centered Design (UCD) that you can use. UCD is an anatomy (or framework) that must be used during the development stage in order to produce a usable product. It's similar to a cheat sheet, a piece of paper that you must pass to each person in the classroom who sits next to you. They must understand that their grade is for their mom, and that the grade is critical in making their mother proud. You should not, of course, cheat.
    </p>
    <p>
        You can imagine the house's designer. Of course, before the framework can be built, the researchers must first gather important information about the user. This will allow us to learn more about the user, pass that information on to the designer, begin construction on the house framework, pass the framework to the house supervisor, and then the supervisor instructs the construction workers on how to use the framework. When we compare this framework for building houses to software development, it's similar to the Swing GUI framework in Java or the Bootstrap framework in JavaScript. As new information about the user becomes available, this framework is refined and refined again during acceptance testing. However, participatory design is where the framework is best refined.
    </p>
    <p>
        Participatory design is a technique for fine-tuning the framework. All stakeholders are involved in participatory design. Employees, suppliers, customers, or end users are all involved in participatory design, for example. Of course, if your general team is involved, this approach will be much more effective. Researchers, developers, testers, and others, for example, are all involved. We design alongside them in participatory design to create an appropriate culture and emotions. This is related to placemaking, which is the process of designing a space based on the people who live there. That is, the community is the focal point of placemaking.
    </p>
    <p>
        When we connect placemaking to participatory design, we're saying that stakeholders know more than the rest of the team. Because you can't conduct participatory design if you don't know what problem you're trying to solve if you're just starting to create a software product, some people try to conduct a literature review to extract some problems before conducting participatory design. Participatory design, on the other hand, only allows us to fine-tune the problem we're trying to solve. This will enable us to create an emotional bond between our target user and the solution we're developing.
