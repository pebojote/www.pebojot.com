        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.
    </p>

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.

        Millions, if not billions, of people who are members of an organization could be involved. Open standards have a higher value than closed standards due to the network effect. Different organizations use the same exchange formats in open standards and protocols in closed standards.

    <p>
        Expert: It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system.

        An emotional attachment to a piece of software is a natural part of the human and computer systems. That's right, their operating systems are in sync. If there are no water purification facilities, raw water collection points, or drainage basins in a water supply system, there will be no water storage, such as water towers. I'm not going to go over every component of the water supply system. I'm simply stating that some components of the water supply system are dependent on others.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you live in a city, you can easily imagine this scenario. This has something to do with the abstraction layer. Between water towers and raw water collection points known as water purification facilities, there is an abstraction layer in a water supply system. Of course, we don't want to drink water that hasn't been purified yet. Anyway, I'm not going to get into hydrologic science right now. But all I'm saying is that between the two parts of the system, there's an abstraction layer that allows them to communicate.
    </p>
    <p>
        Interoperability is the term for this. The abstraction layer is also interoperable because it can communicate with both of these components of the system. It means that the abstraction layer is easily understood by those two parts of the system. As a result, the abstraction layer can bring disparate parts together, and that is the only way to refer to something as a system. In addition, the abstraction layer can be used to make different systems work together. Syntactic interoperability is the term for this. Always keep in mind that there are different workers (organization) for each component. This abstraction layer also enables different organizations to collaborate with one another for mutual benefit. Cross-domain interoperability is the term for this.
    </p>
    <p>
        Cross-domain interoperability is important because it can have a negative impact on both organizations if they can't work together. There is, of course, a problem if you are designing a water supply system and do not allow the fire department to use fire hydrants in your pipe network. This is self-evident and requires no further explanation. However, in terms of the software industry, the water supply system is a close standard organization, while the fire department has an open standard. The open standard is both syntactic and cross-domain interoperable in this case, whereas the closed standard is only syntactic interoperable.
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that the organization's close standard was established because there wasn't one before, and they were the first to do so, or because of monopoly for market dominance. There is no collaboration between different organizations in close standards, but there is collaboration between different systems within the close standard organization. The issue with strict standards, however, is the support group. The support group is so small, by close standards, that you can count them on one hand. The support group for open standards, on the other hand, is much larger. There could be millions, if not billions, of people who are members. So, let us discuss open standards.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support group for open standards is so large that it may include not only the software industry, but also the government and other industries such as healthcare, transportation, education, and so on, and each industry has representatives. The new common protocol can be discussed or even debated by each representative. This new protocol is part of a larger document that promotes common standards. The public was given access to this common document, which has since become an open standard. Because the open standards support group is so large, the open standards have a higher value than closed standards. The network effect is the term for this phenomenon. In open standards, different organizations use the same exchange formats (such as XML or JSON) and protocols (like HTTP or WS).
    </p>
    <p>
        It's possible that an organization's inability to collaborate with other organizations is due to the lack of an open standard. They are instead using a closed standard. Close standards also have financial ramifications for the company. If a product is not interoperable, for example, it may result in a monopoly. Furthermore, monopoly can lead to abuses such as exclusive dealing, in which a new organization entering the market must adjust their system to the monopolist's system. This isn't interoperability; it's compatibility. One example is Apple's removal of the JVM, which forces you to develop iOS apps using their proprietary standards. There will be no need for collaboration because all you have to do is adjust your system to meet their requirements. Apple, on the other hand, changed their mind three weeks after the OpenJDK project was released.
    </p>
    <p>
        Some monopoly abuses are illegal in most countries and may result in the company's dissolution. Breaking up a monopolist means dividing it into smaller organizational entities that are now owned by different people. A monopoly, on the other hand, isn't always a bad thing. It's only a problem if the abuses are widespread among monopolists. The government has the power to easily circumvent the market, so imposing a breakup is not out of the question. The government, on the other hand, supports open standards because they allow new entrants into the market to adjust their systems based on the decisions of multiple organizations rather than just one. This is beneficial because we value the benefits of a large number of people.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we'll talk about cross-origin interoperability and syntactic interoperability. Another type of interoperability is what we call an abstraction layer that connects different systems, the language interoperability. The Java programming language is a good example of language interoperability. Because of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), Java can be used on a variety of systems. However, because different organizations use different programming languages, it is not cross-origin interoperable, but it is syntactically interoperable. As a result, Java is getting closer to the close standard. However, due to OpenJDK, this may not be the case.
    </p>
    <p>
        Because different organizations are working together to create a common protocol, OpenJDK is getting closer to the open standard. However, due to lock-in, OpenJDK may suffer from syntactic interoperability. It means that in the end, you'll be forced to use Oracle JDK. However, we see the problem with using the programming language as an abstraction layer. Another abstraction layer that should be used is referred to as an algorithm. You might be surprised to learn that algorithms are used not only in programming languages, but also in systems. We can use them in system design like system architecture, software architecture, and even information architecture, to name a few applications. As a result, I'd like to talk about them on my blog next.
