    <p>In my earlier article, I discussed the abstraction layer, specifically interoperability. We know that an interoperable object can communicate with other system components. Today, however, I'm going to talk to you about distributed algorithms and system architecture. Isn't it true that computers run algorithms? We give the computer the problem, and it uses an algorithm in a silicon-based processor to solve it.</p>
    <p>But what if the problem is given by the computers? What are our options for resolving the issue? What about the executable code? Where do we get it? Computers, of course, can present us with a problem, which we can then solve using an algorithm (thinking) in our heads. The human brain, like the computer, has a silicon-based processor. A distributed algorithm (or distributed thinking) is when the brain of a human and the silicon-based processor of a computer work together to produce an overall result.</p>
    <p>Distributed thinking is possible because it can take advantage of multiple people's ideas running in parallel. It runs in parallel because different people can collaborate to achieve a common goal. Human-based computation is the term for this. The computer distributes a small unit of work to many people in human-based computation (or HBC), which is also known as microwork, to produce an overall result. If no efficient algorithm has yet been created in the computer for microwork, the computer can use the thinking of different people.</p>
    <p>A computer can divide a large piece of work into small units and distribute them across the internet to a large number of people. Microwork is used in Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT), InnoCentive, and Internet Eyes, among other places. In AMT, it can distribute random work. I'm not going to discuss those jobs because they're completely random. InnoCentive, on the other hand, allows a company to ask you a specific question to solve a problem, and if you answer it correctly, they will pay you $50. In Internet Eyes, you can watch CCTV cameras and alert shop owners if there is a potential theft, and they will pay you for it.</p>
    <p>However, a computer that assigns a small unit of work to various people is limited because it can slow down the work if a specific person's thinking is inefficient, resulting in a poor overall result. We must extend it in order to avoid it. Rather than assigning work solely to humans, we can assign it to both humans and computers. It means that a computer can assign tasks to both humans and machines (CH or CC). This relationship of HC, CH, HH, CC, and other components can form a system, and we must understand it. And by using a language, we can comprehend their relationship.</p>
    <p>This is where the system architecture enters the picture. System architecture entails developing an architecture description language (ADL) to describe the relationships between components so that people (developers and stakeholders) can comprehend the system we're building. There are many different types of ADL, but we will use the United Modelling Language (or UML), which is the best. The structure diagram and the behavior diagram are two diagrams used in UML to understand the relationship between components in a system.</p>
    <p>For example, we can show the developers the structure diagrams (used to create a technical architecture) to help them understand our system, because technical architecture focuses more on the structure of the software/system. Another is we can show the stakeholder the behavior diagram (used to create an application architecture), because application architecture focuses more on the behavior (or functionality) of the software/system. Remember that stakeholders value functionality over structure, because no matter how well-structured your software is, if the functionality fails to meet their needs, it is effectively useless to them. There are open-source tools available to assist you in creating this diagram using UML tools.</p>
    <p>We now talked about technical and application architecture. When discussing technical architecture, always remember to consider non-functional requirements. When discussing application architecture, always keep functional requirements in mind. Now I'd like to talk about functional requirements for a moment. The subject of functional requirements is the functionality of software/system. The implementation of functionality can vary depending on the goal of your stakeholder. So I'm not going to go into any more detail.</p>
    <p>Let us now discuss non-functional requirements. Non-functional requirements concern the structure. Consider the differences between monolithic architecture and microservice structure/architecture. If you're new to system architecture, monolithic architecture is a good place to start because it's easier to build but more difficult to manage.</p>
    <p>In monolithic architecture, all of your components have strong coupling, which means that if you change one, it will have a significant impact on another, potentially causing an imbalance in their relationship. To put it another way, if you change one component, you'll have to change all of the others to rebalance their relationship. Consider a game of jenga. When one piece at the bottom is removed, it has an impact on all of the pieces above it. Consider what would happen if you removed that one piece at the bottom by accident. Naturally, all of the pieces above it will fall. That minor blunder could turn into a major blunder. As a result, a microservice architecture is required.</p>
    <p>You can avoid that small mistake that can turn into a big mistake with microservice architecture. Microservice architecture, on the other hand, is difficult to build but easy to manage, whereas monolithic architecture is easier to build but difficult to manage. All of your components in a microservice architecture have weak coupling, which means that if you change one, it will only have a minor impact on the others.</p>
    <p>Meaning, if you change one component, it will affect some but not all of the others. This component (or service) is also small (or micro) and manageable. Making an orchestration, on the other hand, is context-dependent. In orchestration, however, design patterns are common. Because we all use the same design patterns. The pattern of relationships and interactions among components in orchestration is common.</p>
    <p>However, non-functional requirements may cause each component to differ from the others. Is it necessary for one component to be durable while the other requires flexibility? These non-functional requirements can be used to describe the component's purpose. Information architecture includes describing components, which we will discuss next in my blog.</p>
