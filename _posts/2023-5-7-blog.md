excerpt: In my last article, I talked about distributed algorithms, but I like to talk about something relevant to us. Something that happened on Twitter recently and how it affected its users. Is it positive or negative? That depends on the scale of the emergency for the business.

    <p>When designing a system, you must know what information you need to put on each component. The same thing applies when creating a table in the database. What information that table is holding and when searching for information schema, it is easier to navigate if you have enough rules for naming convention, because in large databases, you are more likely to take hours searching for the information you need to find when, in fact, if you know enough naming convention, it becomes easier.</p>
    <p>The same faith applies even to you as a person searching the internet. I know a lot of us take time to find the information we need. That’s why Google has made Google Scholar easier for researchers to find relevant information. This made it even easier by making an artificial intelligence called Chat GPT connect information together into a single page instead of navigating between pages.</p>
    <p>The function of these AIs is to create or generate text; they lack functionality such as deleting or even editing it. Every system component has unique functionality, and this functionality can be put into a single or separate component in a system. Each of these components has an attribute of information that is connected to the rest and makes the overall system identifiable.</p>
    <p>To make a map of these components, they made a mapping system called a map frame.</p>
    <p>For us human beings, we use tools such as a hammer to construct a house. For communication, we use the telephone. But as time passes, these tools become more and more digital, and we even integrate a paper plane to send new messages and propagate the energy needed to transfer the force of making something move. The architecture of these tools varies depending on the architecture of the data. Most often, the architecture of data is based on business needs. This is much easier data management for businesses, and it reduces the cost of operation. And to avoid risk.</p>
    <p>If the architecture of data is based on business needs, then the tools will, of course, focus on business needs, negating the needs of users. Business often gives us tools we don’t even need, negating the value of the product. It’s like forcing us to use a pen instead of a pickaxe to mine a stone. These business practises are often seen as good for businesses but bad for users. To do something is often the business's decision.</p>
    <p>The map frame of these tools becomes unusable, and the information we dig up becomes useless. To make the information useful, the tool should be useful. To make these tools useful for everyone, map them on the system based on the user’s needs.</p>
    <p>Do we put the right tools in the right room? In your home, you don’t put a hammer in your kitchen to cook. These still depend on the situation; if the business values security, then these tools will be put in different places. These tools will be valuable in some situations.</p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <hr />
    <p>When designing a system, it is important to have enough rules for naming conventions to make it easier to navigate. Google has made Google Scholar and Chat GPT to make it easier for researchers to find relevant information. Each component in a system has unique functionality, which can be put into a single or separate component. A map frame is a system used to make a map of components such as a house, telephone, and paper plane. The architecture of these tools varies depending on the architecture of data, which is often based on business needs.</p>
    <p>To make the information useful, the tool should be useful and should be mapped on the system based on user's needs. To make the tools useful for everyone, it is important to map them on the system based on user's needs.</p>
